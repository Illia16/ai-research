The road is encased in abundant and tall, vibrant sunflower fields, reaching a height of 2 to 2.5 meters. The scene should depict a sunny July day, highlighted by a clear sky and a palpable warm atmosphere. The grandfather is a distinguished-looking man in his 60s, standing 2 meters tall, striding along with the child who is around 1 meter tall. No trees are present in this sunlit landscape, only the endless sea of sunflower fields."
